Customer Care Data Cleaning Project
Welcome to the Customer Care Data Cleaning Project! This repository contains a comprehensive workflow for cleaning and preprocessing a customer care dataset to ensure high-quality and reliable data for further analysis or modeling.

üìÇ Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to clean and prepare a customer care dataset by performing various data cleaning operations, including handling duplicates, correcting field values, restructuring data formats, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers. Additionally, the project involves importing and visualizing an employee dataset.

üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
Importing the Dataset

Loaded the customer care dataset into the workspace for processing.

Removing Duplicate Records

Identified and deleted duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

Dropping Needless Columns

Removed irrelevant or unnecessary columns to focus on essential features.

Correcting Last Name Field

Cleaned the last_name field by removing unnecessary characters and standardizing values.

Restructuring Phone Numbers

Reformatted the phone_number field to a consistent and desired format for easier analysis.

Numerical Encoding

Encoded the categorical fields:

paying_customer

do_not_contact

Converted these fields into numerical values for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

Importing Employee Dataset

Loaded an additional employee dataset for further analysis and cross-referencing.

Data Visualization

Visualized the dataset using boxplots to understand the distribution of numerical features.

Outlier Detection

Identified outliers using statistical methods and boxplot visualization.

Dropping Outliers

Removed outlier records to ensure a clean and robust dataset.

üìä Technologies Used
Python 3.x (jupyter notebook)

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib for data visualization
